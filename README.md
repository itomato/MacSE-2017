# MacSE-2017
## Recipe for a Mac Setup

I scored a Mac SE on half-price day. I dealt with an F 2 sad mac code, which seems to be an intermittent bug. Enough to send this SE off to the heap.

It served the Marketing Department at [E-Mu Systems](http://www.emu.com/) and bears asset tags along with the keyboard, which is correct for the SE.

Someone upgraded it to 4MB RAM, with 1MB SIMMs in each slot. Nothing occupied the PDS slot.

Now running a Seagate 500MB Apple drive from a Power Mac pull, the SE runs System 7.5.0, installed from an archived copy from SyQuest cartridge.

Peripherals are the coolest part of this Mac in my mind, since it's an SE without SuperDrive and sports a candy bar 68000.

## Attached SCSI Peripherals

WeirdStuff came through with a cool pair of SCSI peripherals. I have fond memories of SyQuest drives using the large platters, and picked one up for this setup. CDROM changers are awesome, and the Nakamichi build quality makes for another nice addition. Fully loaded, I've got 500+88+(700x7) Megabytes, most of which is removable storage.
